This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Email Configuration

This application uses Nodemailer to send emails. To enable email functionality:

1. Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project if it doesn't exist
2. Add the following environment variables:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   ```

If you're using Gmail, you'll need to generate an app password:

1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security > 2-Step Verification
3. Scroll down to "App passwords"
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail" and use it as EMAIL_PASSWORD

If no email credentials are provided, the application will fall back to a mock email implementation for development purposes.
